Weather forecasting using LSTM in Python

Dataset Overview
The dataset is centered around air quality and weather data collected hourly over five years from the US embassy in Beijing, China. The primary focus is on forecasting the concentration of PM2.5, a significant air pollutant known for its adverse health effects. The data includes several features that capture both temporal information (date and time) and environmental factors (dew point, temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction, cumulative hours of snow and rain).

Objective
The mission is to leverage Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to build a model that accurately forecasts PM2.5 levels one hour ahead. This problem is framed as a time series forecasting task, where the model uses past observations (weather conditions and pollution levels) to predict future pollution levels.

Results

The overall performance of the LSTM model is strong, with decreasing losses over epochs and a close alignment between predicted and true values. The model effectively learns the temporal patterns in the data, aided by the cyclical nature of the weather variables. The fit between the predicted pollution levels and the actual data suggests that the model can accurately forecast PM2.5 concentrations based on the observed weather conditions.

Conclusion
The LSTM model demonstrates solid performance in forecasting air pollution levels, with both training and testing losses showing consistent improvement over time. The alignment of predicted values with true values further confirms the model's accuracy. The incorporation of time-series analysis for weather variables plays a crucial role in capturing the patterns necessary for accurate predictions, making this model a reliable tool for air pollution forecasting in complex temporal datasets.
